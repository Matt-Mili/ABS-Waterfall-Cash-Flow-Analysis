# ABS-Waterfall-Cash-Flow-Analysis
Python script that simulates an ABS cash flow waterfall for structured finance. It allocates periodic cash flows to tranches (Senior, Mezzanine, Junior) in priority order—paying interest, then principal—and captures residual distributions once all debt is repaid. Results are tabulated and plotted.
